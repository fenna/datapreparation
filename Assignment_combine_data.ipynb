    "- Inspect the dataset for quality and metadata information\n",
    "- Combine data from several tables into one dataframe\n",
    "- Subselect specific data from dataframes\n",
    "- Reshape the dataset into a format suitable for visual and statistical analysis\n",

    "The data is generated by Synthea's COVID-19 module. The data was constructed using three peer-reviewed publications published in the early stages of the global pandemic, when less was known, along with emerging resources, data, publications, and clinical knowledge. The simulation outputs synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR), including the daily consumption of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other medical devices and supplies. For this assignment the `conditions`, `patients`, `observations`, `careplans` and `encounters` table will be used. The Data is stored in separate tables to avoid redundancy, with as a concequence that tables need to be combined and reorganized in dataframes for analysing purpose.\n",
